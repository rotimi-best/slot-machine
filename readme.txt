To implement the scroll logic I swap between 2 or 3 symbols to display in a particular slot. Each slot symbol will be choosen randomly and the amount to as well display(2 or 3) will be as well choosen randomly.
Using this approach makes it feel like a scroll animation due to the speed.

To toggle between random or fixed mode the 'Debug mode' check box has to be ticked.

Additional feature
- Sound effect on win, loose and rolling.
